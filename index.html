<p>I am a musician, mixed media, and digital artist. I sometimes teach technology and art at various Universities and colleges.  I am orginally from Washington DC, appropriately nicknamed, Hollywood for Ugly People." I love politics, the news, reading fiction and non fiction, and getting beat in scrabble by my wife who happens to be a scrabble champion. My main goal in life right now is supporting my twins with lots of love, and a savings account to get them through the UC University system.  I tend to have numerous projects going on at once. I created a music and arts festival in San Francisco that lasted about 15 years. There is a version of it that I helped start in Iowa City. I am currently helping curate and produce another festival in Escondido called Ship In the Woods Festival. I have a visual art show in two weeks in North Park.  I have an art show love technology, creating websites, music, and now learning code.  </p>
